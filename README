A Lane Marker detection project


Requirement
===========

You will need opencv with a version >= 2.4.8

My build
========

g++ 4.9.2
opencv 2.4.10
cmake 2.8


How to build this project
=========================

-   cd build/
-   cmake .
-   make

This will generate a binary named "lm"

How to use
==========

Two ways to use this program:

-   First, you can give it an image and it will output an image with lanes traced in red.
-   Second, you can give it a folder of image and it will compute all the x-position of lanes which intercept with the bottom.
The result will be output in a csv.

Examples:

-   ./lm foo.png
-   ./lm folder/ output.csv
